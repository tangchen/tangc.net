My family and I went to Lake of the Woods in Mahomet, IL this weekend. Summer is pretty much done but I found this white fluffy puffy thing standing beside a sidewalk. Looks like it doesn't want to say goodbye to summer, much like myself... That's why I snapped a photo of it.

By the way, there was a ever so slightly wind going on when I was trying to take this photo, making the dandelion constantly shaking. It was getting dark so I had to slow down the shutter speed, but because of the wind, I couldn't get a sharp image. My wife offered a solution--she gave it a slight pinch ;o)
